            very attached technology that without technology they cannot do
            anything. Another negative impact is privacy, there is no guarantee
            that people uses technology for good purposes. Technology can effect
            people privacy too. Technology also causes pollution. The industrial

            water pollution not only that it also create air pollution by
            releasing industrial harmful smoke in air. Over use of technology
